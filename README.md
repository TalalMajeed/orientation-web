# NUST Orientation '26 — _Ab Kahani Tumhari Hai_

The official web hub for NUST's incoming batch. Two halves in one Next.js app:

1. **The public website** — an editorial landing experience (entry gate, video
   hero, schedule, campus map, contact, newsletter).
2. **The staff panels** — the liaison house/allocation workspace and the HR
   invite-link manager, both backed by MongoDB.

  section/                 Landing sections: hero, welcome, schedule, events, contact, form, legal, footer
  campus/                  Campus map: landmarks (data), view (Leaflet), explorer (filters + map)
  liaison/                 Liaison workspace: shell, overview, houses, students, allocation, emails, accounts, store, sheet, mailer, labels
  hr/                      Invite-link manager

services/                  Server-side logic (never imported by client code)
  auth/                    session signing, role guard, member accounts
  contact/                 contact-form validation + email body
  email/                   Microsoft Graph app-only mailer, bulk campaign runner, templating
  liaison/                 db, allocate, seed, validate, respond, types
  hr/  newsletter/         short links, newsletter subscribers
  security/                headers (CSP etc.), limit (rate limiter)

lib/                       Shared helpers: mongo, request, seo
proxy.ts                   Middleware: rate limits → route guards → security headers
docs/site-structure.md     Route-by-route reference
```

**Conventions:** one lowercase word per filename (`hero.tsx`, `limit.ts`),
folders named the same way, imports through the `@/` alias, and no comments —
names carry the meaning. See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Getting started

**Prerequisites:** Node 20+. MongoDB credentials are only needed for the staff
panels and the newsletter; the public website runs without them.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # esecrets injects env, then starts Next
npx next dev         # website-only: no env needed
```

### Environment

| Variable | Used by |
|---|---|
| `MONGO_DB_URI` | database (liaison workspace, HR links, newsletter) |
| `HR_USERNAME`, `HR_PASSWORD` | admin login |
| `HR_SESSION_SECRET` | session cookie signing |
| `LIAISON_USERNAME`, `LIAISON_PASSWORD` | liaison superadmin login (OG team) |
| `TENANT_ID`, `CLIENT_ID`, `CLIENT_SECRET` | Microsoft Graph app registration (contact form email) |
| `MS_GRAPH_SENDER` | mailbox the app sends *as* — must be inside the Exchange ApplicationAccessPolicy |
| `SECRETS_KEY` | `esecrets` / `npm run secrets` pipeline |

Secrets come from the `esecrets` pipeline. `npm run secrets` fetches them into
`.env` and `secrets.json` directly, if you prefer a local file.

### Scripts

```bash
npm run dev          # dev server with env injected
npm run build        # production build (needs backend env)
npm start            # serve the build
npm run lint         # eslint
npm test             # jest unit tests
npm run e2e          # full HTTP walkthrough of the liaison + newsletter APIs (run npm run build first)
npm run secrets      # write .env from the secrets service
npm run mail-check   # verify the Graph mail path; pass an address to send a test
```

## The website

**Pages:** `/` · `/schedule` · `/map` · `/contact` · `/societies` · `/privacy` · `/terms`

- **Entry gate** (`components/site/gate.tsx`) — a WebGL night sky
  (`site/sky.tsx`) behind the "چلو شروع کریں" button. Dismissing it starts the
  hero video from frame one, unmuted, and fires a `site:entered` event that the
  cookie banner waits for.
- **Hero** (`section/hero.tsx`) — full-viewport video with its own top bar; the
  volume fades to 50% as the section scrolls away.
- **Campus map** (`components/campus/`) — Leaflet map of H-12, filterable by
  category, bounded to campus. Loaded client-side only.
- **Theme** — light/dark via semantic tokens (`--color-surface`, `--color-fg`,
  their `inverse-` pair) that flip on `[data-theme="dark"]`; brand colours
  (ink, navy, blue, sky, ember) stay fixed. Light is the default; the toggle
  sits bottom-right. A pre-paint inline script in `app/layout.tsx` applies the
  stored theme so the page never flashes.
- **Fonts** — ITC Garamond (`font-serif`, display headings), IBM Plex Mono
  (`font-mono`, labels), Niveau Grotesk (`font-italic`), Rakkas (`font-urdu`).
- Site-wide film grain and the slow-spinning `.orbit` ellipse come from
  `components/site/chrome.tsx` and `app/globals.css`.

### Public endpoints

| Endpoint | Who | What |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /api/v1/contact` | anyone | "Say hello" form → email to `support@orientation.nust.edu.pk` |
| `POST /api/v1/newsletter` | anyone | subscribe an address (`201` new, `200` already on the list) |
| `GET /api/v1/newsletter` | admin | list subscribers, newest first |
| `DELETE /api/v1/newsletter` | admin | unsubscribe an address |

**Contact form.** `services/contact/message.ts` validates and renders the mail;
`services/email/graph.ts` sends it app-only through Microsoft Graph as
`MS_GRAPH_SENDER`, with `Reply-To` set to the visitor so staff can answer from
the inbox. `support@` here is only the *recipient* — the Exchange
ApplicationAccessPolicy governs the sending mailbox alone. Run
`npm run mail-check <address>` to prove the path before relying on it.

**Newsletter.** Addresses are normalized and stored in the `newsletter`
collection behind a unique index on `email`, so a repeat submission reports
"already subscribed" rather than duplicating a row — including under
concurrent submissions of the same address.

## Staff panels

Every route is mapped in [`docs/site-structure.md`](docs/site-structure.md).

- **`/admin`** — portal directory; each entry links to the shared staff login.
- **`/liaison`** (liaison, admin or member) — OG houses, merit-list upload, and
  one-click allocation across houses and OG groups, balanced by gender and
  school. State is a single MongoDB document; every `/api/v1/liaison/*`
  endpoint answers with the whole workspace, so the client replaces its state
  instead of merging. The **Emails** tab sends a personalized blast from
  `info@orientation.nust.edu.pk`: upload a list whose first column is the
  address, write a subject and body using `{column_name}` variables, attach
  any files that should ride along, then dispatch. The body is either **Text**
  (line breaks become `<br />`) or **HTML** (your markup is sent as authored,
  with substituted values escaped); the preview renders HTML in a sandboxed
  frame, and **Send test** delivers one copy to any address using the first
  matching recipient's values. The run belongs to the server, so the progress
  bar, the cancel button and resume-where-it-stopped all survive a refresh. The **Accounts** tab belongs to the `LIAISON_USERNAME`
  superadmin alone: it creates member logins (stored salted and scrypt-hashed in
  `liaison_accounts`) that may write in **Emails** and read everything else.
- **`/hr`** (admin) — create, edit and delete short invite links served from
  `/invite/<code>`.

**Security.** `proxy.ts` runs on every request: per-IP fixed-window rate limits
on `/api/*` and `/invite/*`, redirects for guarded prefixes, and CSP/HSTS/frame
/referrer headers on the way out. The redirect is convenience only — each route
handler re-checks the session with `requireRole`, and all request bodies are
re-validated server-side.
